        <h1 class="font1 author">Stock X</h1>
         <p class="font1 author">In the world of e-commerce, security is a top priority for both consumers and companies. The security of online transactions is paramount in building trust between businesses and their customers. Unfortunately, even with the best security measures in place, there are still incidents of cyber attacks that can compromise sensitive information. One such attack happened to StockX, a popular online marketplace for sneakers, streetwear, and other fashion items.</p>
         <p class="font1 author">In communications and information processing, code is a system of rules to convert information—such as a letter, word, sound, image, or gesture—into another form, sometimes shortened or secret, for communication through a communication channel or storage in a storage medium. An early example is the invention of language, which enabled a person, through speech, to communicate what they thought, saw, heard or felt to others. But speech limits the range of communication to the distance a voice can carry, and limits the audience to those present when the speech is uttered . The invention of writing, which converted spoken language into visual symbols, extended the range of communication across space and time.

            The process of encoding converts information from a source into symbols for communication or storage. Decoding is the reverse process, converting code symbols back into a form that the recipient understands, such as English or/and Spanish.
            
            One reason for coding is to enable communication in places where ordinary plain language, spoken or written, is difficult or impossible. For example, semaphore, where the configuration of flags held by a signaler or the arms of a semaphore tower encodes parts of the message, typically individual letters and numbers. Another person standing a great distance away can interpret the flags and reproduce the words sent.</p>

            <p class="font1 author">In August 2019, StockX reported that it had been the target of a data breach that had exposed millions of customers' personal information, including names, email addresses, shipping addresses, and purchase histories. The breach had occurred several months earlier, in May 2019, but the company only became aware of it in July of that year. The breach had resulted in the theft of over 6.8 million user records, including 3.7 million unique email addresses.</p>
         <p class="font1 author">The attack on StockX was a result of a phishing scam, where an attacker tricked an employee into giving up their login credentials. Once the attacker gained access to the employee's account, they were able to access the company's entire customer database. The attacker then put the stolen data up for sale on the dark web, where it was being offered for as much as $300 per record.</p>
            <p class="font1 author">The incident was a significant blow to StockX's reputation, as the company had always touted its commitment to security and the protection of its customers' information. The company had also recently raised over $110 million in funding, which had given it a valuation of over $1 billion. The breach was a reminder that no company is immune to cyber attacks and that even the most robust security measures can be circumvented by a determined attacker.</p>

         <p class="font1 author">The attack on StockX is a cautionary tale for all e-commerce businesses. It highlights the importance of robust security measures, such as two-factor authentication and regular employee training to prevent phishing scams. It also underscores the need for companies to have a comprehensive response plan in place in the event of a breach. An effective response plan can help minimize the damage caused by a breach and restore trust with customers.</p>
            <p class="font1 author">The incident also highlights the importance of transparency and communication in the aftermath of a breach. StockX was quick to notify affected customers and offer them free credit monitoring services, which helped to reassure them that the company was taking the breach seriously. The company's swift and transparent response likely helped to mitigate the damage caused by the breach and preserve its reputation.</p>
